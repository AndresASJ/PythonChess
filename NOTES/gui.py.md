# Detailed Analysis of `gui.py` Functions

## `draw_board(screen, board)`

**Purpose:** Renders the complete chessboard visually, including squares, chess pieces, selected piece highlights, and valid move indicators.

**Parameters:**

- `screen`: Pygame Surface object (canvas for drawing)
    
- `board`: `ChessBoard` instance representing current game state
    

**Return Value:** None (renders directly onto the provided screen surface)

### Detailed Behavior:

#### Board Square Drawing:

- Iterates over an 8×8 grid (rows and columns).
    
- Determines square color using `(row + col) % 2`:
    
    - Even sum: `WHITE`
        
    - Odd sum: `GRAY`
        
- Draws squares using `pygame.draw.rect`:
    
    ```
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, color, (col * SQUARE_SIZE, row * SQUARE_SIZE, SQUARE_SIZE, SQUARE_SIZE))
    ```
    

#### Piece Rendering:

- Retrieves piece from `board.board[row][col]`.
    
- If a piece is present:
    
    - Creates font: `pygame.font.Font(None, 72)`.
        
    - Renders piece symbol:
        
        ```
        text = font.render(piece.symbol, True, piece.color)
        ```
        
    - Calculates centered position for piece symbol.
        
    - Draws piece using `screen.blit`:
        
        ```
        screen.blit(text, text_rect)
        ```
        

#### Selected Piece Highlighting:

- Checks for selected piece (`board.selected_piece`).
    
- Draws a green outline around selected piece's square:
    
    ```
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, GREEN, (selected_col * SQUARE_SIZE, selected_row * SQUARE_SIZE, SQUARE_SIZE, SQUARE_SIZE), 4)
    ```
    
    
        

#### Valid Move Indicators:

- Iterates through `board.valid_moves`.
    
- Draws yellow circles indicating valid moves:
    
    ```
    pygame.draw.circle(screen, YELLOW, (move_col * SQUARE_SIZE + SQUARE_SIZE // 2, move_row * SQUARE_SIZE + SQUARE_SIZE // 2), 10)
    ```

**Importance:**

- Central to the visual representation of chess.
    
- Translates game logic into visual feedback essential for user interaction.
    
- Enhances usability through highlighting and visual cues.

## `draw_status(screen, board, game_over, loser_color)`

**Purpose:** Displays game status information, including the current player’s turn, check status, and game-ending conditions (checkmate).

**Parameters:**

- `screen`: Pygame Surface object for drawing
    
- `board`: `ChessBoard` instance with current state
    
- `game_over`: Boolean indicating checkmate condition
    
- `loser_color`: Color constant (`RED` or `BLUE`) indicating the losing player, or `None` if ongoing
    

**Return Value:** None (renders directly onto provided screen surface)

### Detailed Behavior:

#### Font Creation:

- Generates a smaller font suitable for status messages:
    
    ```
    font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)
    ```
    

#### Game Over State Handling:

- Checks if `game_over` is `True`.
    
- Determines the winner based on `loser_color` and renders an appropriate game-over message, clearly indicating the winning player.
    

**Importance:**

- Provides critical game state feedback.
    
- Enhances player awareness of game progression and outcome.
    
- Clearly communicates game conclusion (checkmate condition) or ongoing state.
