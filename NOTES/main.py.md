# Detailed Analysis of `main.py` Functions

## `main()`

**Purpose:** Serves as the entry point and core game loop for the chess application.

**Parameters:** None

**Return Value:** None (runs continuously until the program exits)

### Detailed Behavior:

#### Pygame Initialization:

- Initializes the game window with dimensions `(WIDTH, HEIGHT)`:
    
    ```
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT))
    ```
    
- Sets the window title to enhance clarity and personalization:
    
    ```
    pygame.display.set_caption("ASJ's Ultimate Chess")
    ```
    

#### Game Components Setup:

- Creates a `Clock` object to control the frame rate:
    
    ```
    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    ```
    
- Initializes the chessboard:
    
    ```
    board = ChessBoard()
    ```
    

#### Game State Variables:

- Sets initial state for game over condition:
    
    ```
    game_over = False
    ```
    
- Initializes loser color to track the losing player:
    
    ```
    loser_color = None
    ```
    

#### Main Game Loop:

- Starts an infinite loop (`while True`) to continuously run the game until terminated.
    

#### Event Handling:

- Processes Pygame events:
    
    - Handles quitting the application:
        
        ```
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()
        ```
        
    - Handles mouse clicks (if game not over):
        
        - Converts pixel coordinates to board coordinates:
            
            ```
            col = event.pos[0] // SQUARE_SIZE
            row = event.pos[1] // SQUARE_SIZE
            ```
            
        - Manages piece selection and moves:
            
            - If a piece is already selected, attempts to move:
                
                ```
                if board.selected_piece:
                    start = board.selected_piece
                    end = (row, col)
                    if board.make_move(start, end):
                        pass  # Successful move logic
                    else:
                        board.selected_piece = None
                        board.valid_moves = []
                ```
                
            - If no piece is selected, selects a new piece:
                
                ```
                else:
                    piece = board.board[row][col]
                    if piece and piece.color == board.current_player:
                        board.selected_piece = (row, col)
                        board.valid_moves = board.get_valid_moves(row, col)
                ```
                

#### Checkmate Detection:

- Continuously checks for checkmate after handling events to ensure the game state remains updated and accurate.
    

**What It Does:**

- Acts as the primary game control loop, managing game states, user input, and game progression.
    
- Essential for continuous gameplay, player interaction, and the implementation of chess logic.
